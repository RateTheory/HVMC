File Descriptions: 
VMCoptions.py - master file to run VMC calculations 
vmc.py - VMC algorithm (adapted from the MATLAB version: https://github.com/gregongie/vmc) described in G. Ongie, R. Willett, R. Nowak, L. Balzano. "Algebraic Variety Models for High-Rank Matrix Completion", in ICML 2017. Available online: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09631 
AnalyzeResults.py - postprocessing VMC output 
calcFreeEnergy.py - supporting file to compute zero-point energy and vibrational free energy contributions
ZCT.py - supporting file to compute transmission coefficient based on zero-curvature tunneling
spline.py - supporting file for transmission coefficient calculation
ResultsPKL\ and ResultsZCT\ and Figures\ - folders where the output files are saved


VMC Procedure:

1. In 'VMCoptions.py', change the filename to the path of any of the pkl files listed in Systems/
2. Set density as a value between 0 and 1: This sets the number of elements of the C matrix that are available to the VMC algorithm. 1-density: data that must be completed
3. Set ntrials to desired value. Since elements in C are masked at random, you need >1 trial (paper uses 100 trials/reaction)
4. Adjust parameters in the VMCoptions() class call
   Do not change 'd=2' as this corresponds to the power of the polynomial
5. Run the file
6. The file generates an output .pkl file, which can be analyzed with 'AnalyzeResults.py' 
7. Set this output filename as the filename in AnalyzeResults.py 
8. Set the filename_true to the original .pkl file from step 1
8. Set temperature for transmission coefficient calculations and set mirroring to true if half of a symmetric MEP is being used
9. Run AnalyzeResults.py to plot model performance
   Set calc_ZCT = True, for activating transmission coefficient calculations based on zero-curvature tunneling
   Set mirror = True, if half of the MEP is used in C matrix (i.e.,SN2 type reactions)
   Set use_trueVAGandE0 = False, to use integral limits EO and VAG of each trial instead of the DFT-calculated (true) values in ZCT calculatiobs
